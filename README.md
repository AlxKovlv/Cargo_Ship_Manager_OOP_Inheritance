## Project Description

The system features a management system for cargo ships, where different types of work orders are implemented using inheritance. For example, the project includes a military contract class that inherits from the base workorder class. This inheritance enables the implementation of specific functionalities related to military contracts, such as data encryption.

## Key Features

- Cargo ship management functionalities
- Inheritance structure for shipment work orders
- Implementation of OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
- User-friendly and intuitive interface
